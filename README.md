## Configuration

### AWS Credentials

The application reads AWS credentials from `voice-recording-api-user_accessKeys.csv`. This file contains:

- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Never commit this file to version control. It's already added to `.gitignore`.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

You can override the default configuration by setting environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=voice-recording-app
export PORT=3001
```

## Security Features

- ‚úÖ **Presigned URLs** with 15-minute expiration
- ‚úÖ **File type validation** (audio files only)
- ‚úÖ **Filename sanitization** to prevent path traversal
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
- ‚úÖ **CORS configuration** for browser security
- ‚úÖ **CSRF protection** headers

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Minimum Version | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Chrome | 49+ | Full support |
| Firefox | 25+ | Full support |
| Edge | 79+ | Full support |
| Safari | 14+ | Full support |
| Opera | 36+ | Full support |

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Permission Denied
- Check browser permissions in settings
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (or localhost for development)
- Try a different browser

### Upload Fails
- Check your internet connection
- Verify AWS credentials are correct
- Ensure S3 bucket exists and has proper CORS configuration

### No Audio Playback
- Check if the file was uploaded successfully
- Verify the file format is supported
- Try downloading and playing the file locally

### Server Won't Start
- Ensure port 3000 is not in use
- Verify AWS credentials file exists
- Check Node.js version (must be 18+)

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses `nodemon` for automatic server restart on file changes.

### Testing Locally

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:3001`
3. Test recording, uploading, and playback
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Monitor server logs for backend issues

## Production Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Update AWS credentials for production environment
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/TLS certificate
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins
- [ ] Enable CloudFront for CDN (optional)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup strategy for S3 bucket

### Deployment Steps

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export NODE_ENV=production
   export PORT=3001
   ```

3. **Start with process manager** (e.g., PM2):
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js --name voice-recorder
   pm2 save
   pm2 startup
   ```
